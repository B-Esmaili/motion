#Value types
Motion can animate:

Numbers: 0, 10 etc.
Strings containing numbers: "0vh", "10px" etc.
Colors: Hex, RGB(A), HSL(A).
Complex strings containing multiple numbers and/or colors (ie "10px 0 #000")
When animating to a non-animatable value like "block", this value will be set instantly. By setting this value within transitionEnd, this value will be set at the end of the animation.
